## Ress

Ress is a very simple CRUD app that allows users to write a simeple post (called a Ress) and publish it.

It is based on [the Netninja Node JS course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jsz4LDYc6kv3ymONOKxwBU).

I named it Ress because I am learning Express.

The course used MongoDB - a NoSQL DB but because of lack good network connectivity and issues with ORMs I settled for a locally setup [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) DB and used [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) as my ORM.

It all worked fine.

I am super pumped to start working on my first Node JS project - a simple To do app.

Thanks for reading.
